# WebRTC_VideoBridge
 The following script demonstrates how to build secure, simple and scalable Video Conferencing. 
 
 The script uses Jitsi Meet. 
 
 Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses Videobridge to provide high quality, secure and scalable video conferences. 
 
 The Jitsi Meet client runs in your browser, without the need for installing anything on your computer. 
 
 Jitsi Meet allows for very efficient collaboration. It allows users to stream their desktop or only some windows. It also supports shared document editing with Etherpad. ## Installation On the client side, no installation is necessary. You just point your browser to the URL of your deployment.
